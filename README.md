# CS106Q
Just want to make a better queue and maybe boost the efficiency.

# Features:

* Sometimes after I've finished debugging one student's assignment, I just thought that this bug might be also useful to other helpers. This queue allows you to post messages on the message board after you've found anything interesting or want to share with other helpers.

* Search for historical messages or helper requests.

* One request - multiple students. There is no reason for us to not helping at the same time to multiple students if they have exactly the same (or at least similar) problems. So the helper requests are structured into two types: 'conceptual' and 'debugging'. Feel free to join any pending or on-going 'conceptual' request you feel related with :)

* Coming soon: as a helper, I could work more efficiently if the current question is similar to other problems I've just solved, so let's harness the power of machine learning, and 'recommend' similar problems to helpers according to the recent helping history.
